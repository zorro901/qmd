# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added Oxlint lint fence.

- `qmd tui` (the SimpleNote-style terminal UI) now supports the mouse end to
  end. Click a list row to select it, double click to open the inline editor,
  right click to arm the delete confirmation (Enter is still required), middle
  click to duplicate, and drag to move the selection. The wheel scrolls the
  note body over the body pane and moves the selection over the list; clicks
  work in the collection picker and dismiss the help overlay; while editing,
  wheel and clicks go to the editor itself.

### Fixed

- `qmd tui`: saving no longer freezes the UI. The file write (~1ms) stays on
  the UI thread while the `qmd update --path` reindex (~1.2-1.7s of Node CLI
  startup per save) runs on a background thread, so typing and scrolling stay
  responsive during and after every save, including the autosave debounce.

- `qmd tui`: Esc and Ctrl-C inside the inline editor now reliably save & exit
  across terminals and SSH sessions. Ctrl-X / Alt-X / Alt-S / F2 remain as
  flow-control-safe alternatives for terminals where Ctrl-S is eaten by XOFF.

## [2.8.3] - 2026-08-16

### Security

- `qmd update` no longer runs a project-local `.qmd/index.yml`'s `update:`
  commands without approval (#886). That file arrives with a `git clone` and is
  adopted automatically for any command run inside the tree, so cloning a
  repository and running `qmd update` executed shell commands chosen by whoever
  wrote it. On a terminal QMD now lists the commands and asks; with nobody to
  ask it skips them and keeps indexing. Approvals are recorded per config file
  and per command set in `<config dir>/trusted.json`, so editing a command — or
  a `git pull` that rewrites one — asks again. New `qmd trust`,
  `qmd trust list` and `qmd trust revoke` manage approvals, and
  `QMD_TRUST_UPDATE_HOOKS=1` opts unattended runs back in. Commands in your own
  `~/.config/qmd/*.yml`, including anything `qmd collection update-cmd` writes,
  are unaffected.

- The same project-local trust gate now covers collection `path` values that
  resolve outside the project and non-default `models.embed` / `models.rerank`
  / `models.generate` URIs (#889). In-project paths still index unattended;
  out-of-project directories are skipped until `qmd trust`, and custom model
  URIs are not loaded or downloaded. `QMD_TRUST_LOCAL_CONFIG=1` opts unattended
  runs back in (and `QMD_TRUST_UPDATE_HOOKS=1` still does). `qmd collection
  add` records trust as it writes, the same way `update-cmd` does.

- Indexing no longer follows file symlinks or glob `../` / absolute patterns
  out of the collection directory. `fast-glob` already skipped symlinked
  directories, but a file symlink (or a mask like `../**/*.md`) still resolved
  via `realpath` and ingested the target. `qmd://` filesystem resolution uses
  the same containment check, so `qmd://collection/../../../etc/passwd` no
  longer produces a path outside the collection.

- `qmd mcp --http` now validates the `Origin` and `Host` headers on every
  request and answers `403` when they name anything but a loopback address
  (#881). Binding to localhost is no defence against the user's own browser:
  a page can re-point its hostname at `127.0.0.1` (DNS rebinding) and read
  the indexed corpus through `POST /query` or `POST /mcp`. Requests with no
  `Origin` (curl, MCP clients, editors) are unaffected. Extend the allowlists
  with `QMD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` / `QMD_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, or set
  `QMD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*` behind your own authenticating proxy. A wildcard
  bind (`--host 0.0.0.0`) skips the host check and warns at startup.

### Changed

- Dependencies: `node-llama-cpp` 3.18.1 → **3.20.0** (llama.cpp b8390 → b10361, 2026-08-11). Also safe patch/minors: `picomatch` 4.0.4 → 4.0.5, `web-tree-sitter` 0.26.8 → 0.26.12, `tsx` 4.21.0 → 4.23.12, `vitest` 3.2.4 → 3.2.7. No zod/vitest major; `@modelcontextprotocol/server` stays 2.0.0 (no 2.x patch). `flake.nix` FOD hashes are not updated here.
- `generate` and query expansion now await `LlamaContextSequence.dispose()` before disposing the parent context. node-llama-cpp 3.20 made sequence dispose async; the library's context-onDispose path does not wait.

- MCP server now speaks protocol revision **2026-07-28** via the official
  TypeScript SDK 2.x (`@modelcontextprotocol/server`). HTTP is sessionless
  (no `Mcp-Session-Id`, no initialize handshake, no idle-session TTL / #816
  reaper). Clients send version and capabilities in `_meta`; `server/discover`
  is implemented; Streamable HTTP POST requires `Mcp-Method` / `Mcp-Name`
  (mismatch → `-32020`); `tools/list` is deterministic and carries `ttlMs` /
  `cacheScope`. 2025-era stdio clients still work (`serveStdio` dual-speak);
  2025-era HTTP `initialize` is answered per-request without minting a
  session. Existing tools (`query` / `get` / `multi_get` / `status`), stdio
  EOF shutdown, and named-index daemon PIDs are unchanged. No release.

- `qmd pull` (and implicit model downloads in `embed`/`query`) no longer print
  node-llama-cpp's download progress bar. The bar redraws every few kilobytes
  and flooded agent transcripts with thousands of tokens (#776). Pass
  `qmd pull --progress` to show it on an interactive terminal.
- `--full-path` no longer degrades silently when a result cannot be resolved on
  disk (#785). A fallback there means the file moved or was deleted since the
  last index, so `search`, `query`, `get` and `multi-get` now print a notice to
  stderr naming how many results fell back and suggesting `qmd update`; stdout
  stays machine-readable.
- `search`/`query` now decide per result whether to show the docid under
  `--full-path`, matching `multi-get` and `get`: a result that resolved shows
  its on-disk path and no docid, one that did not keeps its `qmd://` URI *and*
  its docid, so it is still addressable. Previously the docid was dropped for
  every row whenever the flag was set, leaving unresolved rows with neither a
  usable path nor an identifier.
- `search --format csv` always emits the `docid` column, empty for rows that
  resolved to an on-disk path. Under `--full-path` the header previously
  dropped the column entirely — which also disagreed with the empty-result
  header, always printed with `docid`. Column positions are now stable across
  runs and formats.

### Fixed

- Concurrent first-open of a cold index no longer fails with
  `table documents_fts already exists` on Bun/macOS. FTS5
  `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is not atomic across WAL
  connections: two processes can both see a missing table on their
  schema snapshot and the loser throws. Table create and legacy-schema
  repair now use the same `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` + double-check as the FTS
  sync triggers, and treat a concurrent "already exists" as success
  when the table is present.

- Nix flake `qmd-node-modules` FOD hashes updated for x86_64-linux and
  aarch64-darwin after the MCP SDK 2.0 bump. `nix build` / Nix GHA was
  failing with a fixed-output hash mismatch.

- CJK FTS rebuild no longer skips leftover `fts5(name, body, content='documents')`
  tables when `fts_cjk_normalized_version` is already stamped, and schema
  repair now checks live FTS columns (`PRAGMA table_info`) as well as
  `sqlite_master.sql`. The MCP HTTP test helper still seeds that legacy
  table; `startMcpHttpServer` / `createStore` on it must not throw
  `no such column: T.name` (#792 regression).

- `qmd collection add --glob` is no longer silently ignored. parseArgs ran
  with `strict: false`, so OpenClaw's `--glob memory.md` (and any other
  `--glob`) fell through, the default `**/*.md` was used, and a second
  collection on the same path collided as a duplicate instead of indexing
  the requested mask (#536). `--glob` is now an alias for `--mask`.

- The `bin/qmd` trampoline now execs `process.execPath` instead of
  re-resolving `node` from PATH. Native addons (`better-sqlite3`) are
  compiled for the Node that installed qmd; a version manager (nvm, fnm,
  mise) selecting a different major in the working directory used to spawn
  that other binary and fail with `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` / `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED`
  (#577 leftover; #319). `bun bin/qmd` still resolves `node` from PATH so
  Node-ABI addons are not loaded into bun.

- `qmd update` / `qmd collection add` no longer swallow unreadable files
  silently (#460). `readFileSync` failures (ETIMEDOUT on APFS compressed
  files, EAGAIN, EACCES, …) still skip the file so the rest of the collection
  indexes, but the CLI now warns with the path and error code and reports
  the skip count. The SDK `update()` result includes `skipped`.

- The architecture diagram no longer draws Vec expansions into BM25 search
  (#680). `lex` expansions are FTS-only; `vec` and `hyde` expansions are
  vector-only. The original query still goes to both backends.

- `qmd bench` no longer runs to a wall of 0.00 when the fixture collection is
  missing or empty (#716). It errors up front with the same "Collection not
  found" / index hint as `qmd search -c`, and if every backend still scores
  zero it warns on stderr to check `qmd ls`.

- `qmd cleanup` now reclaims the content and FTS space left behind after a
  wrong-directory `qmd update`. Deactivating files (the next update in the
  right directory) only tombstoned the `documents` rows; cleanup deleted those
  rows and vacuumed, but never dropped the unreferenced `content` hashes and
  never ran FTS5 `optimize`, so `documents_fts_data` kept the old bodies
  (#550). Cleanup now deletes inactive docs, then orphaned content, then
  compact FTS, then vacuum. `--dry-run` reports the content hashes too.

- Concurrent `query` calls with `rerank: true` on a cold MCP server no longer
  race `ensureRerankContexts()`. Embed already serialized context creation;
  rerank did not, so two overlapping first queries both saw an empty pool,
  both created ranking contexts, and the inactivity timer disposed the loser
  (`Object is disposed`, #682). Callers now await the in-flight create.

- Embedding-context pool size no longer assumes every GGUF costs 150 MB of
  VRAM (the nomic-embed figure). Larger models such as Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
  are ~1190 MB per 2048-token context; opening 8 of those exhausted an 8 GB
  card so `qmd query` failed with `Failed to create any rerank context` even
  though the reranker itself was fine. The pool is now sized from the weight
  file, and 1 GB is reserved for the reranker (#799). Default
  embeddinggemma/nomic throughput is unchanged. `QMD_EMBED_PARALLELISM` still
  overrides.

- Multi-collection `-c A -c B` (and SDK/MCP `collections: [A, B]`) no longer
  searches globally then post-filters. A large unrelated collection could fill
  the FTS/ANN top-k so the requested collections vanished, yielding false-empty
  results even though each collection matched on its own. `searchFTS` /
  `searchVec` now search each requested collection, then merge by score
  (#775). Single-collection exact-scan (#791, #803) is unchanged.

- Query expansion no longer consumes caller `intent`, and a cached expansion
  whose sub-queries all miss is dropped instead of replaying forever (#818).
  Intent still steers reranking and snippet/chunk selection; it just no longer
  enters the expansion prompt or cache key, where the model copied meta-language
  ("so I can compare spend settings") into lex/vec terms that matched nothing.

- Files whose names differ only in the characters the legacy slug collapsed to
  `-` (spaces, underscores) no longer evict each other from the index (#717).
  The handalized-path migration now skips any row whose path is still owned by
  a file in the current scan, so it only adopts genuinely stale pre-2.6 rows.
  `qmd get` and `qmd ls <prefix>` also match `_` and `%` in paths literally
  instead of as SQL `LIKE` wildcards, so `qmd get 2026_06_16.md` no longer
  returns a sibling `2026-06-16.md`.

- CLI `multi-get` and SDK/MCP `multi_get` now share one comma-list resolver.
  Collection-prefixed paths (`qmd/docs/SYNTAX.md`) work in both transports,
  unanchored `LIKE '%name'` no longer silently fetches a different document
  for a filename fragment (`NTAX.md` ≠ `SYNTAX.md`), and ambiguous names
  across collections error with the candidate list instead of `LIMIT 1` (#759).

- The Nix flake wrapper now seeds the same pre-import env as `bin/qmd`.
  Nix installs exec `bun src/cli/qmd.ts` directly, so they previously skipped
  the launcher: `qmd mcp` could leak llama/ggml native logs onto JSON-RPC
  stdio, and Darwin CLI exits dumped a ggml Metal residency-set stack trace
  after an otherwise successful query. The wrapper now quiets those logs for
  `mcp` and sets `GGML_METAL_NO_RESIDENCY=1` on Darwin unless
  `QMD_METAL_KEEP_RESIDENCY=1` (#723).

- Rerank context creation no longer swallows the real failure. A VRAM OOM or
  corrupt model previously produced only `Reranker unavailable — skipping
  reranking` (and a dead identical retry whose comment claimed it disabled
  flash attention, which ranking contexts never supported). The warning now
  includes the underlying message so the two cases are distinguishable (#782).

- The Nix flake package now ships `skills/` next to `src/` in `$out/lib/qmd/`.
  `findPackageRoot()` walks up from the wrapped `src/cli/qmd.ts` looking for a
  sibling `skills/` directory; without it, `qmd skill show` and `qmd skills list`
  always failed with "QMD skill not found" on Nix-installed binaries (#722).

- `/release` step 1 no longer points at a missing script. `skills/release/scripts/release-context.sh`
  now exists: it silently installs git hooks and prints version info, working-tree
  status, commits and files since the last tag, `[Unreleased]`, and the previous
  changelog entry. The skill's process list also drops the duplicate step 7 and
  checks dependency updates before cutting the release (#796).

- `store.searchVec()` (and SDK `searchVector()`) now embed the query with the
  store's pinned embed model instead of the global `QMD_EMBED_MODEL`. A store
  created with a non-default `models.embed` previously failed with
  `Dimension mismatch ... Expected N ... received M` and loaded the wrong
  (often much larger) model at query time. Hybrid/precomputed/session search
  paths were unaffected and stay unchanged (#690).

- `qmd collection add --mask "a.md,*.txt"` now indexes the union of each
  pattern. The comma-separated form was documented and commonly guessed, but
  the joined string was passed to fast-glob as one literal glob, so it
  matched zero files with no error. Brace form `{a.md,*.txt}` is unchanged.
  The same split applies on `qmd update` for stored comma-list masks (#557).

- NixOS / immutable-root installs no longer crash `qmd embed` with EACCES
  when node-llama-cpp tries to compile llama.cpp into a read-only
  `node_modules`. The flake wrapper puts Nix's glibc and libstdc++ on
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so prebuilt binaries can `dlopen` them, and
  `getLlama()` uses `build: "never"` when the llama directory is not
  writable (#574).

- CJK FTS rebuild no longer raises "database is busy" when flushing insert
  batches. The streaming `.iterate()` cursor stayed open across
  `BEGIN` on the same connection; the scan now uses keyset-paginated
  `LIMIT` batches so each SELECT finalizes before the insert transaction
  starts (#797).

- Quoted FTS phrases containing dotted tokens (e.g. `"1.0.21"`) now match the
  indexed document. The porter unicode61 tokenizer stores dotted strings as
  adjacent parts, but phrase sanitization stripped the dots into a single
  token (`1021`) that could never hit. Dotted tokens inside quotes are split
  into adjacent phrase terms, matching the bare-term rewrite from #563 (#757).

- `scripts/build.mjs` no longer passes `shell: true` to `spawnSync` on Windows.
  With the default Node install path (`C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`),
  `cmd.exe` split the unquoted `process.execPath` at the space, the `tsc`
  spawn failed, and `prepare` could still report success with no `dist/` —
  leaving `bin/qmd` at "not built". The helper always receives a real binary
  path plus an args array, so no shell is needed. A spawn error now prints
  the missing binary path instead of failing silently. (#681)

- Case-sensitive collections no longer collapse distinct document identities that
  differ only by path casing. The implicit `COLLATE NOCASE` legacy migration was
  unsafe for filesystems that contain both `README.md` and `readme.md`; case-only
  legacy migrations must now be explicit and operator-reviewed (#801).

- `cleanupOrphanedVectors` now runs its orphan count and both DELETEs in a
  single immediate transaction. An interruption between the two DELETEs
  (crash, `SQLITE_BUSY`) could desync `vectors_vec` from `content_vectors`,
  leaving stale metadata rows that make a later reactivation of the same
  content hash look already-embedded — so `qmd embed` skips it and the
  document becomes silently unsearchable by vector, with no orphan left to
  clean up (#766).

- `qmd embed` no longer splits a UTF-16 surrogate pair (emoji, etc.) across a
  chunk boundary. A chunk ending or starting mid-pair produced an unpaired
  surrogate in the chunk text, which some remote embedding APIs reject as
  invalid JSON — permanently failing that chunk on every retry, since the
  boundary calculation is deterministic. This covers both the character-based
  chunker and `chunkDocumentByTokens`'s recursive re-splitting for
  astral-plane-dense content, which could previously drive the char budget
  low enough to reproduce the same split (#777).

- `insertContext` looks up `store_collections` by name. #754 retargeted the
  query from the dropped `collections` table but left `WHERE id = ?`, and
  `store_collections` has `name TEXT PRIMARY KEY` with no `id` column — the
  call threw `no such column: id`. Matches `deleteContext` /
  `updateStoreContext` (#853).

- `qmd collection add` with no path argument now errors with usage instead of
  silently indexing the current working directory (#684). Pass `.` to index
  CWD, matching the documented examples.

- `qmd status` reports orphaned embedding chunks, `qmd update` hints when they
  exceed 10% of vectors, and `qmd cleanup --dry-run` previews what would be
  removed. Incremental update still does not auto-prune vectors (a transient
  empty mount would otherwise force a full re-embed) (#768).

- `qmd --index <name> mcp --http --daemon` now scopes PID/log files per index
  (`mcp-<name>.pid`) and passes the resolved database path to the child, so a
  named-index daemon no longer collides with the default `mcp.pid` or opens
  the default store (#772).

- Opening a store no longer throws `SQLiteError: no such column: T.name` when
  `documents_fts` is still the legacy `fts5(name, body, content='documents')`
  schema. `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` left that table in place, and
  the CJK FTS rebuild's `DELETE FROM documents_fts` compiled against
  `documents.name`, which does not exist (#792).

- Rerank cache keys now include the resolved `models.rerank` URI, so swapping
  the configured reranker no longer serves the previous model's cached scores
  (#764).

- `vsearch -c <collection>` no longer returns empty results for small
  collections crowded out of the global ANN candidate pool. `searchVec` now
  exact-scans the collection's vectors with `vec_distance_cosine` when the
  set is within 20k rows (ANN + post-filter cannot see collections that never
  enter global top-k, and sqlite-vec caps `k` at 4096 so a larger multiplier
  alone is not enough). Larger collections still use capped ANN over-fetch
  (#791, #803).

- `multi-get --format files` now emits the docid as its own CSV field
  (`#docid,path,...`) instead of prepending it into the path field with a
  space (`#docid path,...`), matching `search --format files` and keeping
  naive comma-splitting usable (#760).

- `qmd embed` now takes an exclusive process lock (`.qmd-embed.lock` next to
  the index DB) so concurrent invocations no longer race on `vectors_vec`
  and fail with `UNIQUE constraint failed: vectors_vec.hash_seq`. A second
  embed exits early with `Another embed process is already running. Skipping.`
  Stale locks from crashed processes are recovered via PID identity checks
  (#825).

- windows prepare fix #778 keeps dist build #824

- `qmd mcp` (stdio) now shuts down gracefully when stdin reaches EOF instead
  of orphaning to PID 1 when the parent MCP client dies (#751): the server
  closes its transport, gives in-flight request handlers a bounded window to
  settle, closes the store (which disposes its llama.cpp instance), and lets
  the process drain via `process.exitCode` (no forced `process.exit()`, which
  has caused exit-time native crashes before).

- `qmd --version` no longer reports an unrelated repository's commit (#787).
  The commit was discovered at runtime with `git -C <installDir> rev-parse`,
  and `git -C` walks *up*, so any install nested inside another checkout
  reported that checkout's HEAD — a global npm install under a git-managed
  prefix such as Homebrew's `/opt/homebrew` claimed Homebrew's commit as
  qmd's. Identical tarballs reported different "commits" depending only on
  where they were installed, which is why one issue can collect three distinct
  hashes for the same published build. `scripts/build.mjs` now stamps the
  commit it built from into `dist/cli/build-info.json` (suffixed `-dirty` when
  built from a modified tree), and the runtime prefers that. Source checkouts
  still resolve their own HEAD, but only after confirming the enclosing
  repository is qmd's; anything else reports no commit rather than a
  misleading one. The lookup also no longer interpolates the install path into
  a shell string, so a path containing a space stops silently dropping the
  commit, and `--version` from a build runs no subprocess at all.

- `qmd doctor` no longer false-positives `.etag` HTTP sidecars (written by
  `qmd pull` next to each download) as invalid GGUF models. The model-cache
  check now only inspects real `.gguf` files, so a sidecar that happens to
  sort before the blob no longer poisons the report. #812

- `qmd mcp stop` and `qmd mcp --http --daemon` now verify that a pidfile PID still belongs to a qmd process before signalling it or refusing to start. Recycled PIDs (common after reboot) are treated as stale: the pidfile is unlinked instead of SIGTERM'ing an unrelated process or blocking daemon start with a false "Already running" error (#806).

- `qmd collection add` now rejects missing paths and regular files before
  creating collection configuration or index state. The error reports both the
  received and resolved path so malformed shell arguments can be corrected.

- Claude Code plugin: scope the plugin `source` to `./skills` so installs
  copy just the skills (~50 KB) instead of the entire repository. Previously a
  canonical install materialized ~230 MB / 9,000+ items into
  `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` — including a full npm dependency install
  triggered by the repo-root `package.json`. Both skills (`qmd` and `release`)
  still ship, unchanged. (#790)

- Claude Code plugin: releases now bump the plugin version in
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in lockstep with `package.json`. The
  plugin cache is keyed on this version, and it had been stuck at `0.1.0`
  since February — so installed plugins never received skill updates
  (users who installed in February are still being served that snapshot
  today, despite the qmd skill nearly tripling in size since). Also bumps
  the plugin to `2.6.3` as a one-time catch-up so existing installs pick
  up the current skill on their next `claude plugin update`. (#789)

### Changed

- `--full-path` no longer degrades silently when a result cannot be resolved on
  disk (#785). A fallback there means the file moved or was deleted since the
  last index, so `search`, `query`, `get` and `multi-get` now print a notice to
  stderr naming how many results fell back and suggesting `qmd update`; stdout
  stays machine-readable.
- `search`/`query` now decide per result whether to show the docid under
  `--full-path`, matching `multi-get` and `get`: a result that resolved shows
  its on-disk path and no docid, one that did not keeps its `qmd://` URI *and*
  its docid, so it is still addressable. Previously the docid was dropped for
  every row whenever the flag was set, leaving unresolved rows with neither a
  usable path nor an identifier.
- `search --format csv` always emits the `docid` column, empty for rows that
  resolved to an on-disk path. Under `--full-path` the header previously
  dropped the column entirely — which also disagreed with the empty-result
  header, always printed with `docid`. Column positions are now stable across
  runs and formats.

## [2.6.3] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- `qmd embed --timeout <minutes>` overrides the embed session's max duration
  (previously hardcoded to 30 minutes). Use a larger value to let a big index
  finish in one run, or `--timeout 0` to remove the cap entirely. When the cap is
  reached, remaining document batches are skipped as before, so re-running
  `qmd embed` continues where it left off.

### Documentation

- README: added a "Configuring `index.yml`" section documenting the full config
  schema — `global_context`, `editor_uri`, the `models.embed`/`rerank`/`generate`
  overrides, and per-collection `path`/`pattern`/`ignore`/`update`/
  `includeByDefault`/`context` — with file-location rules (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`,
  `QMD_CONFIG_DIR`, named `{name}.yml`, project-local `.qmd/index.yml`). Every key
  is verified against `src/collections.ts` and its consumers. Documents behavior
  that previously existed only in code, where the absence of docs led contributors
  to repeatedly re-submit already-shipped model-resolution fixes (#502, #559, #564)
  and to request config that already works (#645, #678). Added
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`QMD_CONFIG_DIR` to the environment-variable table and noted
  the `index.yml` `models:` / `QMD_EMBED_MODEL` override path in the Model
  Configuration section.
- README: expanded the per-collection `update` field into an "Automatic update
  commands" subsection — the feature the maintainer publicly called under-documented
  — covering execution via `bash -c` in the collection's directory, the run-then-
  reindex order, the non-zero-exit abort behavior, and the `qmd collection
  update-cmd` set/clear shortcut. The `ignore` key now states it is YAML-only (no
  CLI command) and additive with the un-overridable built-in exclusions.
- `example-index.yml`: overhauled from three near-identical collections into a
  fully-commented starter template where each collection demonstrates a distinct
  feature (hierarchical context, auto-`update`, `ignore` patterns, non-markdown
  globs, `includeByDefault: false`, and an all-fields example), plus commented
  `editor_uri`/`models` stubs. README now links to it. Model URIs are intentionally
  left as placeholders so the template can't drift from the defaults.
- README: documented collection filtering (`-c` semantics), the `collection
  show`/`include`/`exclude`/`update-cmd` subcommands, the `--intent`/`--no-rerank`/
  `-C`/`--full-path` search flags, the `--format <kind>` output selector (with the
  legacy `--json`/`--csv`/`--md`/`--xml`/`--files` booleans noted as aliases),
  `vector-search`/`deep-search` aliases, embed
  memory flags (`--max-docs-per-batch`/`--max-batch-mb`), a sample `--explain`
  score trace, the `qmd doctor`/`qmd init` commands, the `get` `:from:count`
  suffix and `--no-line-numbers`, an MCP tool parameter reference, and a
  Benchmarking section for `qmd bench`.
- docs/SYNTAX.md: removed the non-existent `q` MCP parameter example (the `query`
  tool and REST endpoint accept only the `searches` array) and added a Scoping
  section.
- README: removed the misleading `qmd update --pull` example. The `--pull` flag is
  parsed but never consumed (`updateCollections()` ignores it); the real mechanism
  for running `git pull` before re-indexing is a per-collection `update` command,
  set via `qmd collection update-cmd`.

### Fixed

- MCP server instructions now tell agents to scope with the plural `collections`
  parameter (matching the schema). The previous singular `collection` hint led
  agents to pass a parameter that Zod silently strips, producing unscoped results.
  The `get` instruction line also now documents the full `file.md:from:count`
  range suffix instead of only the single-line `file.md:100` offset.

- Filesystem paths with special characters (`#`, `&`, spaces, `[]`, `()`, etc.)
  now round-trip correctly through index → search → get. Previously
  `reindexCollection` called `handelize()` on relative paths before storing
  them, turning `# Meeting - 234232 3432 __ 5.md` into
  `Meeting-234232-3432-5.md` and making `qmd get <actual-path>`,
  `qmd get --full-path`, and `qmd ls` return dead or garbled paths. Paths are
  now stored verbatim. Existing indexes auto-migrate on the next `qmd update`.

- FTS5 search now correctly matches dotted version strings like `2026.4.10`. The
  `porter unicode61` tokenizer splits on dots (storing `2026`, `4`, `10` as
  separate tokens), but the query sanitizer was stripping dots and producing
  `2026410` which never matched. Dotted terms are now split and ANDed together
  so version-string searches work as expected (#563).
- HTTP REST endpoints `/query` and `/search` now return `qmd://collection/path`
  URIs in the `file` field, matching the output format used by the CLI and MCP
  resource URIs. Previously the raw `displayPath` (`collection/path`) was
  returned without the scheme prefix (#576).
- The embed session `maxDuration` is now env-configurable via
  `QMD_EMBED_MAX_DURATION_MS` (default: 30 min). This prevents large-corpus
  embeddings from being aborted by the hardcoded 30-minute ceiling (#673).
- `qmd query`, `qmd update`, and other commands no longer fail with
  `SQLiteError: database is locked` when multiple processes run against the
  same index in parallel (e.g. an `update` racing a long `embed`, the
  first-open schema migration racing a routine command, or an agent fanning
  out searches). `openDatabase` now sets `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 120000` on
  every connection, so a writer that loses the race queues at batch
  boundaries instead of throwing immediately. WAL handles read/write
  concurrency but does not serialise concurrent writers, and `bun:sqlite`
  and `better-sqlite3` both default the timeout to 0, so the loser
  previously failed on the first DDL statement in `initializeDatabase`.
  Override the default with `QMD_SQLITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT` (milliseconds; `0`
  restores fail-fast). Two more crashes on the same concurrent-open
  path are fixed: `trigger documents_ai already exists` (the FTS sync
  triggers were dropped and recreated as separate statements on every
  open, so two processes interleaved between the `DROP` and the
  `CREATE`; `busy_timeout` serialises individual statements but not the
  pair) and `database is locked` while migrating a cold database to WAL
  (the `journal_mode` switch needs a brief exclusive lock and does not
  invoke the busy handler). FTS trigger setup is now gated behind
  `PRAGMA user_version` inside one `IMMEDIATE` transaction, and the WAL
  migration retries within the busy-timeout budget.

## [2.5.3] - 2026-05-28

### Features

- `qmd get` now accepts a `:from:count` suffix on a path or docid (e.g.
  `qmd get "#abc123:120:40"` reads 40 lines starting at line 120). Explicit
  `--from`/`-l` flags still override the suffix. The MCP `get` tool accepts the
  same suffix.
- `qmd get` and `qmd multi-get` are now **line-numbered by default** and print
  the document's `#docid` and `qmd://` path in the output header. Disable line
  numbers with `--no-line-numbers`. The MCP `get`/`multi_get` tools default
  `lineNumbers` to `true` to match.
- `qmd multi-get` now includes the `#docid` in every output format
  (`--md`, `--json`, `--csv`, `--xml`, `--files`, and the default CLI view),
  consistent with `qmd search`.
- `qmd get` and `qmd multi-get` accept `--full-path`, which replaces the
  `qmd://` path + `#docid` with the document's on-disk filesystem path (handy for
  piping into `Read`/`Edit`/an editor). Falls back to the canonical `qmd://` +
  docid header when the file no longer exists on disk.
- `qmd search` / `qmd query` now show a clearer hit identifier: the default CLI
  view (and the new `**file:**` line in `--md` output) always prints the full
  `qmd://collection/path` URI so you can pipe it straight back into `qmd get`.
- `qmd search` / `qmd query` accept `--full-path` with the same semantics as
  `qmd get`: the result label becomes the file's on-disk path — `./`-prefixed
  relative path when the file lives in a subfolder of `$PWD`, absolute realpath
  otherwise — and the per-result `#docid` is dropped because the path is the
  identifier. The leading `./` is intentional so the output is unambiguously a
  filesystem path. Applies to all output formats.
- `qmd get` and `qmd multi-get` now also use the `./`-prefixed convention when
  `--full-path` renders a path under `$PWD`, matching `search`/`query`.
- New `--format <kind>` flag selects the output format (`cli` | `json` | `csv` |
  `md` | `xml` | `files`) for `search`, `query`, and `multi-get`. The legacy
  boolean aliases (`--json`/`--csv`/`--md`/`--xml`/`--files`) still work but are
  no longer in `--help`; prefer `--format`.

### Fixes

- Launcher: source-mode runner selection now prefers Node + tsx over Bun when
  both `package-lock.json` and `bun.lock` are present in the package root,
  mirroring the dist-mode "npm priority" rule. Fixes pnpm-global installs that
  copy the entire working tree (including `.git` and `bun.lock`) into the
  install dir and previously routed through Bun, causing ABI mismatches with
  the Node-built `better-sqlite3` / `sqlite-vec` native modules.
- Darwin Metal: llama-using commands (`query`, `vsearch`, `embed`) no longer
  dump a multi-kB GGML/Metal backtrace at process exit even when output
  succeeded. The libggml-metal static `ggml_metal_device` destructor asserts
  `[rsets->data count] == 0` during `__cxa_finalize_ranges`, but the
  buffer-free path never calls the symmetric `ggml_metal_device_rsets_rm`
  to remove released rsets from the device collection (upstream
  ggml-org/llama.cpp#22593, one-line fix open as PR #22595). The assertion
  only fires when `process.exit()` skips Node's `beforeExit` hook, which is
  what node-llama-cpp uses to auto-dispose Metal contexts. Primary fix:
  `finishSuccessfulCliCommand` now sets `process.exitCode = 0` and returns
  instead of calling `process.exit(0)`, so `beforeExit` fires and the native
  binding cleans up before libc's static destructor runs. Defense-in-depth:
  the launcher (`bin/qmd`) and the npm test driver (`scripts/test-all.mjs`
  + the `test:bun` / `test:unit` package.json scripts) also set
  `GGML_METAL_NO_RESIDENCY=1` on darwin before spawning node/bun, covering
  error paths and tests that still terminate via `process.exit()`. The env
  var must be set before node/bun start — libggml-metal reads it via libc
  `getenv` at module-load time, and Bun does not propagate `process.env`
  mutations to libc `setenv` — so it lives in the launcher rather than in
  test-preload. Residency sets give no measurable speedup for QMD's
  short-lived CLI workflow (benchmarked on M3 Pro). Opt back in with
  `QMD_METAL_KEEP_RESIDENCY=1` for long-lived qmd processes (e.g. the MCP
  daemon may benefit on hot reload) or to triage the upstream fix.
  `qmd doctor` reports the mitigation state. Minimal reproduction:
  `scripts/repro-metal-rsets-crash.mjs`.

### Docs

- qmd skill: emphasize reading line ranges with `get`'s built-in
  `:from:count` suffix / `--from`/`-l` flags instead of piping through
  `sed`/`head`/`tail`; cite the docid and line numbers now present in retrieval
  output; and author structured `intent:`/`lex:`/`vec:`/`hyde:` queries yourself
  rather than relying on built-in query expansion.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-05-22

### Fixes

- Launcher: Rewrite `bin/qmd` as a Node-based shebang polyglot to fix global npm installation execution failures on Windows (#668 / #452), while supporting seamless fallback to Bun in Node-less environments.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-05-20

### Changes

- Release: publish from GitHub Actions via npm Trusted Publishing/OIDC instead of a long-lived `NPM_TOKEN` secret.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-19

### Changes

- Dependencies: update core SQLite/config/chunking packages (`better-sqlite3`, `yaml`, `web-tree-sitter`, `tree-sitter-go`, and `tree-sitter-python`) while keeping incompatible `zod`, `tsx`, and `vitest` majors pinned.
- Agent skills: add `qmd skills list|get|path` to serve version-matched runtime skill instructions from the installed CLI, and make `qmd skill install` write a stable discovery stub so installed agent skills do not go stale after QMD upgrades.
- CLI: add `qmd doctor` for index/runtime diagnostics, including SQLite/sqlite-vec versions, embedding fingerprint freshness, mixed-fingerprint detection, safe legacy fingerprint adoption, and content-hash sampling.

### Fixes

- Launcher: prefer runnable TypeScript source in git checkouts even when ignored `dist/` artifacts exist, while packaged installs continue to run `dist/`.
- GPU: keep node-llama-cpp's documented `gpu: "auto"` initialization as the primary path, then perform no-build packaged CUDA/Vulkan/Metal probes only if auto falls back to CPU.
- CLI: move GPU/CPU runtime diagnostics out of `qmd status`; use `qmd doctor` for device probing and related environment guidance.
- CLI: point unexpected command/setup failures toward `qmd doctor` so diagnostics are the default next step when QMD behaves incorrectly.
- Doctor: explicitly warn when `content_vectors` contains multiple non-empty embedding fingerprint names, with the per-fingerprint document/chunk breakdown.
- Embed: make the TTY progress line label byte-based input progress explicitly, show embedded chunks as a count, and shorten the displayed model name.
- Embed: retain per-chunk failure details, retry failed chunks after later successful embeds and again when no other chunks remain, clear recovered errors, and cap retries to avoid endless loops.
- Tests: expand the container smoke harness to cover npm-global, npx-style, and Bun-global install scenarios, always checking auto and `QMD_FORCE_CPU=1` doctor modes, with opt-in tiny `qmd embed` and GPU probe runs for supported container runtimes.
- Embedding: fingerprint vector metadata using the active embedding model and formatting/chunking parameters so stale vectors are treated as pending after search semantics change. Legacy `content_vectors` columns are migrated lazily on first vector-health/write use to preserve fast QMD startup.

- Skill: expand the packaged QMD skill with retrieval-first workflows, structured query examples, wiki/source collection guidance, and safe fallbacks when model-backed search is unavailable.
- Tests: make `bun run test` execute the local unit suite under both Node/Vitest and Bun (`test:node` + `test:bun`) so runtime-specific regressions are caught before CI.
- Model config: centralize embedding/rerank/generation model resolution so `qmd embed`, `status`, `query`, `vsearch`, `pull`, SDK vector search, and `bench` use the same active `.qmd/index.yaml` model hints and environment fallbacks.
- GPU/status: `qmd status` now uses the same embedding model identity as `qmd embed` when computing pending embeddings, so URI-backed embeddings are not incorrectly reported as pending under the legacy `embeddinggemma` alias.
- GPU status: `qmd status` now always shows GPU mode/configuration without unsafe native probing, and CPU-fallback warnings point to `QMD_STATUS_DEVICE_PROBE=1 qmd status` for an actual backend probe. The no-GPU warning is emitted once per process instead of once per LLM instance during benchmarks.
- GPU: add `QMD_FORCE_CPU=1` / `--no-gpu` to bypass CUDA/Vulkan/Metal probing entirely, and route native llama.cpp stdout noise to stderr so JSON output stays parseable during search/query commands.
- Snippet line numbers: `qmd_query` (MCP), HTTP `/query`, and `qmd query`
  (CLI JSON output and snippet headers) now return absolute source-file
  line numbers instead of chunk-local ones, so the `line` field can be
  passed back to `qmd_get` as `fromLine` without a separate lookup.
  Snippet selection remains scoped to the best matching chunk
  (preserves #149).
- CLI: `qmd query --full` now emits the full document body in all output
  formats (json, csv, md, xml), restoring the documented behavior of the
  flag. Previously it returned only the best matching chunk (~3.6KB max
  per result). Output payload for `--full` queries is now proportional
  to total document size.
- macOS Metal: `qmd query --json` now flushes successful JSON output and uses a safe immediate-exit path on Darwin to avoid ggml Metal finalizer aborts; other commands still dispose LLM contexts/models before the llama runtime. #368
- Embedding: require complete chunk coverage before treating a document as
  embedded, remove partial vectors when chunk/session failures leave a
  document incomplete, and keep `qmd status` pending counts honest after
  interrupted long embed runs. #637 #378
- Embedding: `qmd embed -c <collection>` now scopes pending-doc selection
  to the requested collection instead of embedding global pending work.
  Scoped `--force` clears only collection-owned vectors, preserves shared
  hashes referenced by sibling collections, and drops `vectors_vec` only
  when the scoped clear empties all vectors.
- Hybrid search: weight RRF lists by query type so original FTS and original vector evidence get the intended 2x boost, instead of accidentally boosting the first lexical expansion. #591
- MCP: seed llama.cpp/GGML quiet env vars before launching `qmd mcp` so native logs cannot pollute stdio JSON-RPC framing. #593
- CLI: remove CommonJS `require()` calls from ESM index path normalization so `qmd --index <path>` no longer crashes with `ERR_AMBIGUOUS_MODULE_SYNTAX` on Node 22+. #634
- Windows CUDA: serialize llama.cpp embedding/reranking contexts by default to avoid intermittent `ggml-cuda.cu:98` crashes in `qmd query`; set `QMD_EMBED_PARALLELISM` to opt back into parallel contexts if your driver is stable. #519
- MCP: make `qmd mcp --index <name>` use the selected index for both foreground and daemon HTTP servers instead of falling back to the default store. #343
- Embedding: respect `QMD_EMBED_MODEL` consistently for vector indexing and vector-backed search, with default-model fallback when unset.
- Config: use one home-directory resolver for YAML config and the default SQLite cache path, avoiding Windows CLI/MCP split-brain when `HOME` is unset.
- GPU: respect explicit `QMD_LLAMA_GPU=metal|vulkan|cuda` backend overrides instead of always using auto GPU selection. #529
- Fix: preserve original filename case in `handelize()`. The previous
  `.toLowerCase()` call made indexed paths unreachable on case-sensitive
  filesystems (Linux). `qmd update` automatically migrates legacy
  lowercase paths without re-embedding.
- CLI: make `qmd status` skip native `node-llama-cpp` device probing by
  default so status stays safe on machines with broken or unsupported GPU
  drivers. Set `QMD_STATUS_DEVICE_PROBE=1` to opt in.
- CLI: lazy-load `node-llama-cpp` so lightweight commands such as
  `qmd status` do not import native ML dependencies or trigger llama.cpp
  builds on ARM/no-GPU machines. #491
- Store: keep content rows referenced by inactive documents during orphan
  cleanup so `qmd update` preserves soft-deleted tombstones for removed
  files. #585
- Packaging: install AST grammar WASM packages as required dependencies so
  Bun global installs include TypeScript/TSX/JavaScript grammars, and add a
  `smoke:package-grammars` verification command. #595
- Launcher: add wrapper smoke coverage for scoped package, npm/npx,
  Homebrew/Linuxbrew, Bun global symlink layouts, and `$BUN_INSTALL`
  false-positive runtime selection regressions. #351 #353 #354 #356 #358 #359

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-05

Code files now chunk at function and class boundaries via tree-sitter,
clickable editor links land you at the right line from search results,
and per-collection model configuration means you can point different
collections at different embedding models. 25+ community PRs fix
embedding stability, BM25 accuracy, and cross-platform launcher issues.

### Changes

- AST-aware chunking for code files via `web-tree-sitter`. Supported
  languages: TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust. Code files
  are chunked at function, class, and import boundaries instead of
  arbitrary text positions. Markdown and unknown file types are unchanged.
  `--chunk-strategy <auto|regex>` flag on `qmd embed` and `qmd query`
  (default `regex`). SDK: `chunkStrategy` option on `embed()` and
  `search()`. `qmd status` shows grammar availability.
- `qmd bench <fixture.json>` command for search quality benchmarks.
  Measures precision@k, recall, MRR, and F1 across BM25, vector, hybrid,
  and full pipeline backends. Ships with an example fixture against
  the eval-docs test collection. #470 (thanks @jmilinovich)
- `models:` section in `index.yml` lets you configure `embed`, `rerank`,
  and `generate` model URIs per collection. Resolution order is
  config > env var (`QMD_EMBED_MODEL`, `QMD_RERANK_MODEL`,
  `QMD_GENERATE_MODEL`) > built-in default. #502
  (thanks @JohnRichardEnders)
- CLI search output now emits clickable OSC 8 terminal hyperlinks when
  stdout is a TTY. Links resolve `qmd://` paths to absolute filesystem
  paths and open in editors via URI templates (default:
  `vscode://file/{path}:{line}:{col}`). Configure with `QMD_EDITOR_URI`
  or `editor_uri` in the YAML config. #508 (thanks @danmackinlay)
- `--no-rerank` flag skips the reranking step in `qmd query` — useful
  when you want fast results or don't have a GPU. Also exposed as
  `rerank: false` on the MCP `query` tool. #370 (thanks @mvanhorn),
  #478 (thanks @zestyboy)
- ONNX conversion script for deploying embedding models via
  Transformers.js. #399 (thanks @shreyaskarnik)
- GitHub Actions workflow to build the Nix flake on Linux and macOS.

### Fixes

- Embedding: prevent `qmd embed` from running indefinitely when the
  embedding loop stalls. #458 (thanks @ccc-fff)
- Embedding: truncate oversized text before embedding to prevent GGML
  crash, and bound memory usage during batch embedding. #393
  (thanks @lskun), #395 (thanks @ProgramCaiCai)
- Embedding: set explicit embed context size (default 2048, configurable
  via `QMD_EMBED_CONTEXT_SIZE`) instead of using the model's full
  window. #500
- Embedding: error on dimension mismatch instead of silently rebuilding
  the vec0 table. #501
- Embedding: handle vec0 `OR REPLACE` limitation in `insertEmbedding`.
  #456 (thanks @antonio-mello-ai)
- Embedding: fix model selection when multiple models are configured.
  #494
- BM25: correct field weights to include all 3 FTS columns — title,
  body, and path were not weighted correctly. #462 (thanks @goldsr09)
- BM25: handle hyphenated tokens in FTS5 lex queries so terms like
  "real-time" match correctly. #463 (thanks @goldsr09)
- BM25: preserve underscores in search terms instead of stripping them.
  #404
- BM25: use CTE in `searchFTS` to prevent query planner regression with
  collection filter.
- Reranker: increase default context size 2048→4096 and make
  configurable via `QMD_RERANK_CONTEXT_SIZE`. Fix template overhead
  underestimate 200→512. #453 (thanks @builderjarvis)
- GPU: catch initialization failures and fall back to CPU instead of
  crashing.
- MCP: read version from `package.json` instead of hardcoding. #431
- MCP: include collection name in status output. #416
- Multi-get: support brace expansion patterns in glob matching. #424
- Launcher: prioritize `package-lock.json` to prevent Bun false
  positive. #385 (thanks @rymalia)
- Launcher: remove `$BUN_INSTALL` check that caused false Bun detection.
  #362 (thanks @syedair)
- Launcher: skip Git Bash path detection on WSL. #371
  (thanks @oysteinkrog)
- Model cache: respect `XDG_CACHE_HOME` for model cache directory. #457
  (thanks @antonio-mello-ai)
- SQLite: add macOS Homebrew SQLite support for Bun and restore
  actionable errors. #377 (thanks @serhii12)
- Pin zod to exact 4.2.1 to fix `tsc` build failure. #382
  (thanks @rymalia)
- Preserve dots and original case in `handelize()` — filenames like
  `MEMORY.md` no longer become `memory-md`. #475 (thanks @alexei-led)
- Include `line` in `--json` search output so editor integrations can
  jump directly to `file:line`. #506 (thanks @danmackinlay)
- Nix: fix paths in flake and make Bun dependency a fixed-output
  derivation so sandboxed Linux builds work offline. #479
  (thanks @surma-dump)
- Sync stale `bun.lock` (`better-sqlite3` 11.x → 12.x). CI and release
  script now use `--frozen-lockfile` to prevent recurrence. #386
  (thanks @Mic92)
- Approve native build scripts in pnpm so `better-sqlite3` and
  tree-sitter modules compile correctly. Update vitest ^3.0.0 → ^3.2.4.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-10

### Changes

- `qmd skill install` copies the packaged QMD skill into
  `~/.claude/commands/` for one-command setup. #355 (thanks @nibzard)

### Fixes

- Fix Qwen3-Embedding GGUF filename case — HuggingFace filenames are
  case-sensitive, the lowercase variant returned 404. #349 (thanks @byheaven)
- Resolve symlinked global launcher path so `qmd` works correctly when
  installed via `npm i -g`. #352 (thanks @nibzard)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-10

QMD 2.0 declares a stable library API. The SDK is now the primary interface —
the MCP server is a clean consumer of it, and the source is organized into
`src/cli/` and `src/mcp/`. Also: Node 25 support and a runtime-aware bin wrapper
for bun installs.

### Changes

- Stable SDK API with `QMDStore` interface — search, retrieval, collection/context
  management, indexing, lifecycle
- Unified `search()`: pass `query` for auto-expansion or `queries` for
  pre-expanded lex/vec/hyde — replaces the old query/search/structuredSearch split
- New `getDocumentBody()`, `getDefaultCollectionNames()`, `Maintenance` class
- MCP server rewritten as a clean SDK consumer — zero internal store access
- CLI and MCP organized into `src/cli/` and `src/mcp/` subdirectories
- Runtime-aware `bin/qmd` wrapper detects bun vs node to avoid ABI mismatches.
  Closes #319
- `better-sqlite3` bumped to ^12.4.5 for Node 25 support. Closes #257
- Utility exports: `extractSnippet`, `addLineNumbers`, `DEFAULT_MULTI_GET_MAX_BYTES`

### Fixes

- Remove unused `import { resolve }` in store.ts that shadowed local export

## [1.1.6] - 2026-03-09

QMD can now be used as a library. `import { createStore } from '@tobilu/qmd'`
gives you the full search and indexing API — hybrid query, BM25, structured
search, collection/context management — without shelling out to the CLI.

### Changes

- **SDK / library mode**: `createStore({ dbPath, config })` returns a
  `QMDStore` with `query()`, `search()`, `structuredSearch()`, `get()`,
  `multiGet()`, and collection/context management methods. Supports inline
  config (no files needed) or a YAML config path.
- **Package exports**: `package.json` now declares `main`, `types`, and
  `exports` so bundlers and TypeScript resolve `@tobilu/qmd` correctly.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-03-07

Ambiguous queries like "performance" now produce dramatically better results
when the caller knows what they mean. The new `intent` parameter steers all
five pipeline stages — expansion, strong-signal bypass, chunk selection,
reranking, and snippet extraction — without searching on its own. Design and
original implementation by Ilya Grigorik (@vyalamar) in #180.

### Changes

- **Intent parameter**: optional `intent` string disambiguates queries across
  the entire search pipeline. Available via CLI (`--intent` flag or `intent:`
  line in query documents), MCP (`intent` field on the query tool), and
  programmatic API. Adapted from PR #180 (thanks @vyalamar).
- **Query expansion**: when intent is provided, the expansion LLM prompt
  includes `Query intent: {intent}`, matching the finetune training data
  format for better-aligned expansions.
- **Reranking**: intent is prepended to the rerank query so Qwen3-Reranker
  scores with domain context.
- **Chunk selection**: intent terms scored at 0.5× weight alongside query
  terms (1.0×) when selecting the best chunk per document for reranking.
- **Snippet extraction**: intent terms scored at 0.3× weight to nudge
  snippets toward intent-relevant lines without overriding query anchoring.
- **Strong-signal bypass disabled with intent**: when intent is provided, the
  BM25 strong-signal shortcut is skipped — the obvious keyword match may not
  be what the caller wants.
- **MCP instructions**: callers are now guided to provide `intent` on every
  search call for disambiguation.
- **Query document syntax**: `intent:` recognized as a line type. At most one
  per document, cannot appear alone. Grammar updated in `docs/SYNTAX.md`.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-07

13 community PRs merged. GPU initialization replaced with node-llama-cpp's
built-in `autoAttempt` — deleting ~220 lines of manual fallback code and
fixing GPU issues reported across 10+ PRs in one shot. Reranking is faster
through chunk deduplication and a parallelism cap that prevents VRAM
exhaustion.

### Changes

- **GPU init**: use node-llama-cpp's `build: "autoAttempt"` instead of manual
  GPU backend detection. Automatically tries Metal/CUDA/Vulkan and falls back
  gracefully. #310 (thanks @giladgd — the node-llama-cpp author)
- **Query `--explain`**: `qmd query --explain` exposes retrieval score traces
  — backend scores, per-list RRF contributions, top-rank bonus, reranker
  score, and final blended score. Works in JSON and CLI output. #242
  (thanks @vyalamar)
- **Collection ignore patterns**: `ignore: ["Sessions/**", "*.tmp"]` in
  collection config to exclude files from indexing. #304 (thanks @sebkouba)
- **Multilingual embeddings**: `QMD_EMBED_MODEL` env var lets you swap in
  models like Qwen3-Embedding for non-English collections. #273 (thanks
  @daocoding)
- **Configurable expansion context**: `QMD_EXPAND_CONTEXT_SIZE` env var
  (default 2048) — previously used the model's full 40960-token window,
  wasting VRAM. #313 (thanks @0xble)
- **`candidateLimit` exposed**: `-C` / `--candidate-limit` flag and MCP
  parameter to tune how many candidates reach the reranker. #255 (thanks
  @pandysp)
- **MCP multi-session**: HTTP transport now supports multiple concurrent
  client sessions, each with its own server instance. #286 (thanks @joelev)

### Fixes

- **Reranking performance**: cap parallel rerank contexts at 4 to prevent
  VRAM exhaustion on high-core machines. Deduplicate identical chunk texts
  before reranking — same content from different files now shares a single
  reranker call. Cache scores by content hash instead of file path.
- Deactivate stale docs when all files are removed from a collection and
  `qmd update` is run. #312 (thanks @0xble)
- Handle emoji-only filenames (`🐘.md` → `1f418.md`) instead of crashing.
  #308 (thanks @debugerman)
- Skip unreadable files during indexing (e.g. iCloud-evicted files returning
  EAGAIN) instead of crashing. #253 (thanks @jimmynail)
- Suppress progress bar escape sequences when stderr is not a TTY. #230
  (thanks @dgilperez)
- Emit format-appropriate empty output (`[]` for JSON, CSV header for CSV,
  etc.) instead of plain text "No results." #228 (thanks @amsminn)
- Correct Windows sqlite-vec package name (`sqlite-vec-windows-x64`) and add
  `sqlite-vec-linux-arm64`. #225 (thanks @ilepn)
- Fix claude plugin setup CLI commands in README. #311 (thanks @gi11es)

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-06

### Fixes

- Reranker: truncate documents exceeding the 2048-token context window
  instead of silently producing garbage scores. Long chunks (e.g. from
  PDF ingestion) now get a fair ranking.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-20

QMD now speaks in **query documents** — structured multi-line queries where every line is typed (`lex:`, `vec:`, `hyde:`), combining keyword precision with semantic recall. A single plain query still works exactly as before (it's treated as an implicit `expand:` and auto-expanded by the LLM). Lex now supports quoted phrases and negation (`"C++ performance" -sports -athlete`), making intent-aware disambiguation practical. The formal query grammar is documented in `docs/SYNTAX.md`.

The npm package now uses the standard `#!/usr/bin/env node` bin convention, replacing the custom bash wrapper. This fixes native module ABI mismatches when installed via bun and works on any platform with node >= 22 on PATH.

### Changes

- **Query document format**: multi-line queries with typed sub-queries (`lex:`, `vec:`, `hyde:`). Plain queries remain the default (`expand:` implicit, but not written inside the document). First sub-query gets 2× fusion weight — put your strongest signal first. Formal grammar in `docs/SYNTAX.md`.
- **Lex syntax**: full BM25 operator support. `"exact phrase"` for verbatim matching; `-term` and `-"phrase"` for exclusions. Essential for disambiguation when a term is overloaded across domains (e.g. `performance -sports -athlete`).
- **`expand:` shortcut**: send a single plain query (or start the document with `expand:` on its only line) to auto-expand via the local LLM. Query documents themselves are limited to `lex`, `vec`, and `hyde` lines.
- **MCP `query` tool** (renamed from `structured_search`): rewrote the tool description to fully teach AI agents the query document format, lex syntax, and combination strategy. Includes worked examples with intent-aware lex.
- **HTTP `/query` endpoint** (renamed from `/search`; `/search` kept as silent alias).
- **`collections` array filter**: filter by multiple collections in a single query (`collections: ["notes", "brain"]`). Removed the single `collection` string param — array only.
- **Collection `include`/`exclude`**: `includeByDefault: false` hides a collection from all queries unless explicitly named via `collections`. CLI: `qmd collection exclude <name>` / `qmd collection include <name>`.
- **Collection `update-cmd`**: attach a shell command that runs before every `qmd update` (e.g. `git stash && git pull --rebase --ff-only && git stash pop`). CLI: `qmd collection update-cmd <name> '<cmd>'`.
- **`qmd status` tips**: shows actionable tips when collections lack context descriptions or update commands.
- **`qmd collection` subcommands**: `show`, `update-cmd`, `include`, `exclude`. Bare `qmd collection` now prints help.
- **Packaging**: replaced custom bash wrapper with standard `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang on `dist/qmd.js`. Fixes native module ABI mismatches when installed via bun, and works on any platform where node >= 22 is on PATH.
- **Removed MCP tools** `search`, `vector_search`, `deep_search` — all superseded by `query`.
- **Removed** `qmd context check` command.
- **CLI timing**: each LLM step (expand, embed, rerank) prints elapsed time inline (`Expanding query... (4.2s)`).

### Fixes

- `qmd collection list` shows `[excluded]` tag for collections with `includeByDefault: false`.
- Default searches now respect `includeByDefault` — excluded collections are skipped unless explicitly named.
- Fix main module detection when installed globally via npm/bun (symlink resolution).

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-18

### Changes

- LLM: add LiquidAI LFM2-1.2B as an alternative base model for query
  expansion fine-tuning. LFM2's hybrid architecture (convolutions + attention)
  is 2x faster at decode/prefill vs standard transformers — good fit for
  on-device inference.
- CLI: support multiple `-c` flags to search across several collections at
  once (e.g. `qmd search -c notes -c journals "query"`). #191 (thanks
  @openclaw)

### Fixes

- Return empty JSON array `[]` instead of no output when `--json` search
  finds no results.
- Resolve relative paths passed to `--index` so they don't produce malformed
  config entries.
- Respect `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` for collection config path instead of always
  using `~/.config`. #190 (thanks @openclaw)
- CLI: empty-collection hint now shows the correct `collection add` command.
  #200 (thanks @vincentkoc)

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-16

### Changes

- CLI: `qmd status` now shows models with full HuggingFace links instead of
  static names in `--help`. Model info is derived from the actual configured
  URIs so it stays accurate if models change.
- Release tooling: pre-push hook handles non-interactive shells (CI, editors)
  gracefully — warnings auto-proceed instead of hanging on a tty prompt.
  Annotated tags now resolve correctly for CI checks.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-16

The npm package now ships compiled JavaScript instead of raw TypeScript,
removing the `tsx` runtime dependency. A new `/release` skill automates the
full release workflow with changelog validation and git hook enforcement.

### Changes

- Build: compile TypeScript to `dist/` via `tsc` so the npm package no longer
  requires `tsx` at runtime. The `qmd` shell wrapper now runs `dist/qmd.js`
  directly.
- Release tooling: new `/release` skill that manages the full release
  lifecycle — validates changelog, installs git hooks, previews release notes,
  and cuts the release. Auto-populates `[Unreleased]` from git history when
  empty.
- Release tooling: `scripts/extract-changelog.sh` extracts cumulative notes
  for the full minor series (e.g. 1.0.0 through 1.0.5) for GitHub releases.
  Includes `[Unreleased]` content in previews.
- Release tooling: `scripts/release.sh` renames `[Unreleased]` to a versioned
  heading and inserts a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` section automatically.
- Release tooling: pre-push git hook blocks `v*` tag pushes unless
  `package.json` version matches the tag, a changelog entry exists, and CI
  passed on GitHub.
- Publish workflow: GitHub Actions now builds TypeScript, creates a GitHub
  release with cumulative notes extracted from the changelog, and publishes
  to npm with provenance.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-15

QMD now runs on both Node.js and Bun, with up to 2.7x faster reranking
through parallel GPU contexts. GPU auto-detection replaces the unreliable
`gpu: "auto"` with explicit CUDA/Metal/Vulkan probing.

### Changes

- Runtime: support Node.js (>=22) alongside Bun via a cross-runtime SQLite
  abstraction layer (`src/db.ts`). `bun:sqlite` on Bun, `better-sqlite3` on
  Node. The `qmd` wrapper auto-detects a suitable Node.js install via PATH,
  then falls back to mise, asdf, nvm, and Homebrew locations.
- Performance: parallel embedding & reranking via multiple LlamaContext
  instances — up to 2.7x faster on multi-core machines.
- Performance: flash attention for ~20% less VRAM per reranking context,
  enabling more parallel contexts on GPU.
- Performance: right-sized reranker context (40960 → 2048 tokens, 17x less
  memory) since chunks are capped at ~900 tokens.
- Performance: adaptive parallelism — context count computed from available
  VRAM (GPU) or CPU math cores rather than hardcoded.
- GPU: probe for CUDA, Metal, Vulkan explicitly at startup instead of
  relying on node-llama-cpp's `gpu: "auto"`. `qmd status` shows device info.
- Tests: reorganized into flat `test/` directory with vitest for Node.js and
  bun test for Bun. New `eval-bm25` and `store.helpers.unit` suites.

### Fixes

- Prevent VRAM waste from duplicate context creation during concurrent
  `embedBatch` calls — initialization lock now covers the full path.
- Collection-aware FTS filtering so scoped keyword search actually restricts
  results to the requested collection.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-15

First published release on npm as `@tobilu/qmd`. MCP HTTP transport with
daemon mode cuts warm query latency from ~16s to ~10s by keeping models
loaded between requests.

### Changes

- MCP: HTTP transport with daemon lifecycle — `qmd mcp --http --daemon`
  starts a background server, `qmd mcp stop` shuts it down. Models stay warm
  in VRAM between queries. #149 (thanks @igrigorik)
- Search: type-routed query expansion preserves lex/vec/hyde type info and
  routes to the appropriate backend. Eliminates ~4 wasted backend calls per
  query (10.0 → 6.0 calls, 1278ms → 549ms). #149 (thanks @igrigorik)
- Search: unified pipeline — extracted `hybridQuery()` and
  `vectorSearchQuery()` to `store.ts` so CLI and MCP share identical logic.
  Fixes a class of bugs where results differed between the two. #149 (thanks
  @igrigorik)
- MCP: dynamic instructions generated at startup from actual index state —
  LLMs see collection names, doc counts, and content descriptions. #149
  (thanks @igrigorik)
- MCP: tool renames (vsearch → vector_search, query → deep_search) with
  rewritten descriptions for better tool selection. #149 (thanks @igrigorik)
- Integration: Claude Code plugin with inline status checks and MCP
  integration. #99 (thanks @galligan)

### Fixes

- BM25 score normalization — formula was inverted (`1/(1+|x|)` instead of
  `|x|/(1+|x|)`), so strong matches scored *lowest*. Broke `--min-score`
  filtering and made the "strong signal" short-circuit dead code. #76 (thanks
  @dgilperez)
- Normalize Unicode paths to NFC for macOS compatibility. #82 (thanks
  @c-stoeckl)
- Handle dense content (code) that tokenizes beyond expected chunk size.
- Proper cleanup of Metal GPU resources on process exit.
- SQLite-vec readiness verification after extension load.
- Reactivate deactivated documents on re-index instead of creating duplicates.
- Bun UTF-8 path corruption workaround for non-ASCII filenames.
- Disable following symlinks in glob.scan to avoid infinite loops.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-28

Fine-tuned query expansion model trained with GRPO replaces the stock Qwen3
0.6B. The training pipeline scores expansions on named entity preservation,
format compliance, and diversity — producing noticeably better lexical
variations and HyDE documents.

### Changes

- LLM: deploy GRPO-trained (Group Relative Policy Optimization) query
  expansion model, hosted on HuggingFace and auto-downloaded on first use.
  Better preservation of proper nouns and technical terms in expansions.
- LLM: `/only:lex` mode for single-type expansions — useful when you know
  which search backend will help.
- LLM: HyDE output moved to first position so vector search can start
  embedding while other expansions generate.
- LLM: session lifecycle management via `withLLMSession()` pattern — ensures
  cleanup even on failure, similar to database transactions.
- Integration: org-mode title extraction support. #50 (thanks @sh54)
- Integration: SQLite extension loading in Nix devshell. #48 (thanks @sh54)
- Integration: AI agent discovery via skills.sh. #64 (thanks @Algiras)

### Fixes

- Use sequential embedding on CPU-only systems — parallel contexts caused a
  race condition where contexts competed for CPU cores, making things slower.
  #54 (thanks @freeman-jiang)
- Fix `collectionName` column in vector search SQL (was still using old
  `collectionId` from before YAML migration). #61 (thanks @jdvmi00)
- Fix Qwen3 sampling params to prevent repetition loops — stock
  temperature/top-p caused occasional infinite repeat patterns.
- Add `--index` option to CLI argument parser (was documented but not wired
  up). #84 (thanks @Tritlo)
- Fix DisposedError during slow batch embedding. #41 (thanks @wuhup)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-09

First community contributions. The project gained external contributors,
surfacing bugs that only appear in diverse environments — Homebrew sqlite-vec
paths, case-sensitive model filenames, and sqlite-vec JOIN incompatibilities.

### Changes

- Indexing: native `realpathSync()` replaces `readlink -f` subprocess spawn
  per file. On a 5000-file collection this eliminates 5000 shell spawns,
  ~15% faster. #8 (thanks @burke)
- Indexing: single-pass tokenization — chunking algorithm tokenized each
  document twice (count then split); now tokenizes once and reuses. #9
  (thanks @burke)

### Fixes

- Fix `vsearch` and `query` hanging — sqlite-vec's virtual table doesn't
  support the JOIN pattern used; rewrote to subquery. #23 (thanks @mbrendan)
- Fix MCP server exiting immediately after startup — process had no active
  handles keeping the event loop alive. #29 (thanks @mostlydev)
- Fix collection filter SQL to properly restrict vector search results.
- Support non-ASCII filenames in collection filter.
- Skip empty files during indexing instead of crashing on zero-length content.
- Fix case sensitivity in Qwen3 model filename resolution. #15 (thanks
  @gavrix)
- Fix sqlite-vec loading on macOS with Homebrew (`BREW_PREFIX` detection).
  #42 (thanks @komsit37)
- Fix Nix flake to use correct `src/qmd.ts` path. #7 (thanks @burke)
- Fix docid lookup with quotes support in get command. #36 (thanks
  @JoshuaLelon)
- Fix query expansion model size in documentation. #38 (thanks @odysseus0)

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-28

Replaced Ollama HTTP API with node-llama-cpp for all LLM operations. Ollama
adds convenience but also a running server dependency. node-llama-cpp loads
GGUF models directly in-process — zero external dependencies. Models
auto-download from HuggingFace on first use.

### Changes

- LLM: structured query expansion via JSON schema grammar constraints.
  Model produces typed expansions — **lexical** (BM25 keywords), **vector**
  (semantic rephrasings), **HyDE** (hypothetical document excerpts) — so each
  routes to the right backend instead of sending everything everywhere.
- LLM: lazy model loading with 2-minute inactivity auto-unload. Keeps memory
  low when idle while avoiding ~3s model load on every query.
- Search: conditional query expansion — when BM25 returns strong results, the
  expensive LLM expansion is skipped entirely.
- Search: multi-chunk reranking — documents with multiple relevant chunks
  scored by aggregating across all chunks rather than best single chunk.
- Search: cosine distance for vector search (was L2).
- Search: embeddinggemma nomic-style prompt formatting.
- Testing: evaluation harness with synthetic test documents and Hit@K metrics
  for BM25, vector, and hybrid RRF.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-13

Collections and contexts moved from SQLite tables to YAML at
`~/.config/qmd/index.yml`. SQLite was overkill for config — you can't share
it, and it's opaque. YAML is human-readable and version-controllable. The
migration was extensive (35+ commits) because every part of the system that
touched collections or contexts had to be updated.

### Changes

- Config: YAML-based collections and contexts replace SQLite tables.
  `collections` and `path_contexts` tables dropped from schema. Collections
  support an optional `update:` command (e.g., `git pull`) before re-index.
- CLI: `qmd collection add/list/remove/rename` commands with `--name` and
  `--mask` glob pattern support.
- CLI: `qmd ls` virtual file tree — list collections, files in a collection,
  or files under a path prefix.
- CLI: `qmd context add/list/check/rm` with hierarchical context inheritance.
  A query to `qmd://notes/2024/jan/` inherits context from `notes/`,
  `notes/2024/`, and `notes/2024/jan/`.
- CLI: `qmd context add / "text"` for global context across all collections.
- CLI: `qmd context check` audit command to find paths without context.
- Paths: `qmd://` virtual URI scheme for portable document references.
  `qmd://notes/ideas.md` works regardless of where the collection lives on
  disk. Works in `get`, `multi-get`, `ls`, and context commands.
- CLI: document IDs (docid) — first 6 chars of content hash for stable
  references. Shown as `#abc123` in search results, usable with `get` and
  `multi-get`.
- CLI: `--line-numbers` flag for get command output.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-10

MCP server for AI agent integration. Without it, agents had to shell out to
`qmd search` and parse CLI output. The monolithic `qmd.ts` (1840 lines) was
split into focused modules with the project's first test suite (215 tests).

### Changes

- MCP: stdio server with tools for search, vector search, hybrid query,
  document retrieval, and status. Runs over stdio transport for Claude
  Desktop and MCP clients.
- MCP: spec-compliant with June 2025 MCP specification — removed non-spec
  `mimeType`, added `isError: true` to errors, `structuredContent` for
  machine-readable results, proper URI encoding.
- MCP: simplified tool naming (`qmd_search` → `search`) since MCP already
  namespaces by server.
- Architecture: extract `store.ts` (1221 LOC), `llm.ts` (539 LOC),
  `formatter.ts` (359 LOC), `mcp.ts` (503 LOC) from monolithic `qmd.ts`.
- Testing: 215 tests (store: 96, llm: 60, mcp: 59) with mocked Ollama for
  fast, deterministic runs. Before this: zero tests.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-08

Document chunking for vector search. A 5000-word document about many topics
gets a single embedding that averages everything together, matching poorly for
specific queries. Chunking produces one embedding per ~900-token section with
focused semantic signal.

### Changes

- Search: markdown-aware chunking — prefers heading boundaries, then paragraph
  breaks, then sentence boundaries. 15% overlap between chunks ensures
  cross-boundary queries still match.
- Search: multi-chunk scoring bonus (+0.02 per additional chunk, capped at
  +0.1 for 5+ chunks). Documents relevant in multiple sections rank higher.
- CLI: display paths show collection-relative paths and extracted titles
  (from H1 headings or YAML frontmatter) instead of raw filesystem paths.
- CLI: `--all` flag returns all matches (use with `--min-score` to filter).
- CLI: byte-based progress bar with ETA for `embed` command.
- CLI: human-readable time formatting ("15m 4s" instead of "904.2s").
- CLI: documents >64KB truncated with warning during embedding.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-08

### Changes

- CLI: `--json`, `--csv`, `--files`, `--md`, `--xml` output format flags.
  `--json` for programmatic access, `--files` for piping, `--md`/`--xml` for
  LLM consumption, `--csv` for spreadsheets.
- CLI: `qmd status` shows index health — document count, size, embedding
  coverage, time since last update.
- Search: weighted RRF — original query gets 2x weight relative to expanded
  queries since the user's actual words are a more reliable signal.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-07

Initial implementation. Built in a single day for searching personal markdown
notes, journals, and meeting transcripts.

### Changes

- Search: SQLite FTS5 with BM25 ranking. Chose SQLite over Elasticsearch
  because QMD is a personal tool — single binary, no server dependencies.
- Search: sqlite-vec for vector similarity. Same rationale: in-process, no
  external vector database.
- Search: Reciprocal Rank Fusion to combine BM25 and vector results. RRF is
  parameter-free and handles missing signals gracefully.
- LLM: Ollama for embeddings, reranking, and query expansion. Later replaced
  with node-llama-cpp in 0.6.0.
- CLI: `qmd add`, `qmd embed`, `qmd search`, `qmd vsearch`, `qmd query`,
  `qmd get`. ~1800 lines of TypeScript in a single `qmd.ts` file.
